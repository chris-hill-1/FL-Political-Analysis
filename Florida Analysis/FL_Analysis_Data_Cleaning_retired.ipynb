    "3. Identify the counties and precincts with the greatest swing from D to R over the course of multiple elections\n",
    "4. Identify the counties and precincts surrounded by precincts that swung in an opposite direction -- essentially, identifying where people diverge most from their neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, I will be drawing data from the Florida Division of Elections precinct level election results (https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/elections-data/precinct-level-election-results/).\n",

    "## Step 1: Reformat and Ingest Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into analysis, we have to ingest and clean a **lot** of data, a task to which this entire notebook will be dedicated. The data available from the FDOE is available in .txt format (*yay*) for each county for each election, so we'll have to turn 67 .txt files into one dataframe *for each year we want to investigate*. We'll start with our earliest year of data, which is from the 2012 general election. From here, we can define a standard set of columns into which will:\n",
