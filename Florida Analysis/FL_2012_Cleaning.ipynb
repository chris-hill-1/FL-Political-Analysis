    "# Florida Electoral Analysis - Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate objectives of this project are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify precincts friendliest to Ds in R counties\n",
    "2. Identify the counties and precincts with the greatest swing from R to D over the course of multiple elections\n",
    "3. Identify the counties and precincts with the greatest swing from D to R over the course of multiple elections\n",
    "4. Identify the counties and precincts surrounded by precincts that swung in an opposite direction -- essentially, identifying where people diverge most from their neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, I will be drawing data from the Florida Division of Elections precinct level election results (https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/elections-data/precinct-level-election-results/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data flow for this project will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ingest data from .txt files into dataframes using Python and pandas\n",
    "2. Examine and clean dataframes using Python and pandas\n",
    "3. Save the cleaned dataframes to .csv\n",
    "4. Upload .csv data to BigQuery for storage and easier querying\n",
    "5. Conduct analysis on data using Python and numpy\n",
    "6. Create visualizations that convey analysis using Python, matplotlib, and seaborn\n",
    "7. Use GIS tools (QGIS) to map data onto the state of Florida\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: I recognize this may not be a particularly efficient work flow, and involves using more tools than may be strictly necessary; that is intentional. My goal is to develop my skills across these tools and platforms, especially as regards moving the same dataset from one tool to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Reformat and Ingest Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into analysis, we have to ingest and clean a **lot** of data, a task to which this entire notebook will be dedicated. The data available from the FDOE is available in .txt format (*yay*) for each county for each election, so we'll have to turn 67 .txt files into one dataframe *for each year we want to investigate*. We'll start with our earliest year of data, which is from the 2012 general election. From here, we can define a standard set of columns into which will:\n",
